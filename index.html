    <h1>FOOTBALL - WIKIPEDIA </h1>
    <p>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.
        Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is
        used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in North America and
        Oceania); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football;
        rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football.[1] These various forms of football share to varying extent
        common origins and are known as football codes.

        There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different
        parts of the world.[2][3][4] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these
        games at English public schools during the 19th century.[5][6] The expansion and cultural influence of the
        British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly
        controlled Empire.[7] By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic
        football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to
        maintain their heritage.[8] In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many
        professional football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to
        become some of the most popular team sports in the world</p>

    <h1>FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION</h1>
    <p>During the early 1860s, there were increasing attempts in England to unify and reconcile the various public
        school games. In 1862, J. C. Thring, who had been one of the driving forces behind the original Cambridge Rules,
        was a master at Uppingham School and he issued his own rules of what he called "The Simplest Game" (these are
        also known as the Uppingham Rules). In early October 1863 another new revised version of the Cambridge Rules was
        drawn up by a seven member committee representing former pupils from Harrow, Shrewsbury, Eton, Rugby,
        Marlborough and Westminster.

        At the Freemasons' Tavern, Great Queen Street, London on the evening of 26 October 1863, representatives of
        several football clubs in the London Metropolitan area met for the inaugural meeting of The Football Association
        (FA). The aim of the Association was to establish a single unifying code and regulate the playing of the game
        among its members. Following the first meeting, the public schools were invited to join the association. All of
        them declined, except Charterhouse and Uppingham. In total, six meetings of the FA were held between October and
        December 1863. After the third meeting, a draft set of rules were published. However, at the beginning of the
        fourth meeting, attention was drawn to the recently published Cambridge Rules of 1863. The Cambridge rules
        differed from the draft FA rules in two significant areas; namely running with (carrying) the ball and hacking
        (kicking opposing players in the shins). The two contentious FA rules were as follows:

        IX. A player shall be entitled to run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal if he makes a fair catch, or
        catches the ball on the first bound; but in case of a fair catch, if he makes his mark he shall not run.
        X. If any player shall run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal, any player on the opposite side shall be
        at liberty to charge, hold, trip or hack him, or to wrest the ball from him, but no player shall be held and
        hacked at the same time.[109]

        At the fifth meeting it was proposed that these two rules be removed. Most of the delegates supported this, but
        F. M. Campbell, the representative from Blackheath and the first FA treasurer, objected. He said: "hacking is
        the true football". However, the motion to ban running with the ball in hand and hacking was carried and
        Blackheath withdrew from the FA. After the final meeting on 8 December, the FA published the "Laws of Football",
        the first comprehensive set of rules for the game later known as Association Football. The term "soccer", in use
        since the late 19th century, derives from an Oxford University abbreviation of "Association".[110]

        The first FA rules still contained elements that are no longer part of association football, but which are still
        recognisable in other games (such as Australian football and rugby football): for instance, a player could make
        a fair catch and claim a mark, which entitled him to a free kick; and if a player touched the ball behind the
        opponents' goal line, his side was entitled to a free kick at goal, from 15 yards (13.5 metres) in front of the
        goal line.</p>
    <h1>POPULARITY</h1>
    <p>Several of the football codes are the most popular team sports in the world.[9] Globally, association football is
        played by over 250 million players in over 200 nations,[134] and has the highest television audience in
        sport,[135] making it the most popular in the world.[136] American football, with 1.1 million high school
        football players and nearly 70,000 college football players, is the most popular sport in the United
        States,[137][138] with the annual Super Bowl game accounting for nine of the top ten of the most watched
        broadcasts in U.S. television history.[139] The NFL has the highest average attendance (67,591) of any
        professional sports league in the world and has the highest revenue[140] out of any single professional sports
        league.[141] Thus, the best association football and American football players are among the highest paid
        athletes in the world.[142][143][144]

        Australian rules football has the highest spectator attendance of all sports in Australia.[145][146] Similarly,
        Gaelic football is the most popular sport in Ireland in terms of match attendance,[147] and the All-Ireland
        Football Final is the most watched event of that nation's sporting year.[148]

        Rugby union is the most popular sport in New Zealand, Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji.[149] It is also the fastest
        growing sport in the U.S.[150][151][152][153] with college rugby being the fastest growing[clarification
        needed][154][155] college sport in that country.[156][dubious â€“ discuss]</p>
